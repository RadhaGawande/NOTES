/************** MAVEN COMMANDS AND LIFE CYCLE ******************************\

Command used in maven?
Maven Commands:
mvn clean: Cleans the project and removes all files generated by the previous build.
mvn compile: Compiles source code of the project.
mvn test-compile: Compiles the test source code.
mvn test: Runs tests for the project.
mvn package: Creates JAR or WAR file for the project to convert it into a distributable format.
mvn install: Deploys the packaged JAR/ WAR file to the local repository.
mvn deploy: Copies the packaged JAR/ WAR file to the remote repository after compiling, running tests and building the project.
Maven Commands

mvn test-compile: 
mvn --version Prints out the version of Maven you are running.

1)What is Maven? and Its Usage
Maven is a Build tool 
it is Project Management tool 
compiling source code
Maven also Manages the dependencies


2)How to create a Maven Project?
Goto file in Eclipse
New-->Maven Project
if you don't see the option of Maven then
Goto other & serach Maven select Maven Project
Next give the default option as it is
select archetype - org.apache.maevn.archetype maven-archetype-quickstart 
next 
enter GroupId & ArtiFactId
by default there is name of package change it and finish.


3)Which commands we are using in cmd for Maven?
Command Purpose:-Building the maven project from commandline.

For Creating Project through cmd-:
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.bharti -DartifactId=hellomaven -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false

For executing maven Project on cmd-:
goto directory of project 
cd projectname
mvn install
-> Jar will be created
now for executing jar file inside the project we use the command -: java -cp target/jar file name(.jar)

4)Maven Life cycle?
When we build a Maven project, it executes a set of clearly defined tasks based on the project pom.xml configuration and the command-line options. 
This standard set of tasks creates the maven build lifecycle.
The benefit of a clearly defined lifestyle is that we have to remember only a few sets of commands to compile, build, install, and deploy our projects.
1)There are three built-in build lifecycles.
default: handles project build and deployment
clean: handles project cleaning
site: handles the creation of project site documentation.
2)Maven build lifecycle goes through a set of stages, they are called build phases.
For example, the default lifecycle is made up of the following phases.
validate,compile,test,package,verify,install,deploy
The build phases are executed sequentially. When we run a maven build command, we specify the phase to be executed.
Any maven build phases that come before the specified phase is also executed. 
For example, if we run mvn package then it will execute validate, compile, test, and package phases of the project.
3)A build phase is made up of a set of goals. Maven goals represent a specific task that contributes to the building and managing of a project.
Sometimes, a maven goal is not bound to a build phase. We can execute these goals through the command line.
The syntax to execute a goal is:$ mvn plugin-prefix:goal
$ mvn plugin-group-id:plugin-artifact-id[:plugin-version]:goal
